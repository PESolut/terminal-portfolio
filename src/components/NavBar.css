/*

Quick flex refresher (for me or whoever’s reading this later):

  - `justify-content` handles how items are spaced along the main axis
    (which defaults to horizontal unless you change `flex-direction`).

    Think of it like text alignment—left, center, spaced out, etc.

  - `align-items` handles how stuff lines up *along the cross axis* 
    (basically the opposite direction of your main one).

  The axis changes depending on what you set `flex-direction` to,
  so keep that in mind when centering things.
